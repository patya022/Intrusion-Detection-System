# Intrusion-Detection-System
A Machine Learning-based Intrusion Detection System using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes.
# Intrusion Detection System (IDS)  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
This project implements a Machine Learning-based **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** using different classification algorithms to detect network intrusions.  

## ðŸ“Š Features  
- Supports **Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes**  
- Uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for feature reduction  
- Visualizes **decision boundaries**  
- **Multi-threaded execution** for performance  

## ðŸ”§ Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Intrusion-Detection-System.git
   cd Intrusion-Detection-System
